**jsrepo** is a CLI that takes inspiration from the way that [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) allows you install portable blocks of code.

The goal of **jsrepo** is to make this method of distributing code simpler and more maintainable.

It does this by unifying the tooling it takes to build a registry, with the tooling to distribute it. As well as providing a rich feature set to make maintaining that code much easier.
